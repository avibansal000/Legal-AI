2. the disputes relate to 3 contracts for the supply of bedsteads by the respondent - bungo steel furniture pvt. ltd - (hereinafter called the 'company') to the appellant, namely, contract no. a.t. 3116 for the supply of 17202 bedsteads, contract no. a.t. 767 for the supply of 30, 000 bedsteads and contract no. a. t. 816 for the supply of 7, 000 bedsteads. each of these contracts contained the usual arbitration clause embodied in cl. 21 of the general conditions of contract in form no. w.s.b. 133. the disputes arising between the company and the appellant out of the three contracts were referred to the arbitration of sir rupen mitter. the award of the arbitrator is, dated september 2, 1959. the arbitrator found that the company was entitled to be credited with the sum of rupees 11, 64, 423 on account of the price (inclusive of the price of steel) of the bedsteads supplied under the three contracts made up of (a) a sum of rs. 4, 12, 848 for the price of 17, 202 bedsteads supplied under contract no. a.t. 3116 at rs. 24 per bedstead, (b) rs. 7, 05, 000 for the price of 30, 000 bedsteads supplied under contract no. a.t. 767 at rs. 23-8-0 per bedstead and (c) rs. 46, 575 for the price of 2, 025 bedsteads supplied under contract no. a.t. 816. the appellant undertook to supply the requisite steel at basic rates and the price of steel so supplied was payable by the company on presentation of material release orders called 'm.r.os'. the arbitrator found that the company was entitled to a credit for rs. 3, 42, 737 for payment on m.r.os. for the price of steel and the appellant was entitled to credits for rs. 29, 188 on account of railway freight and transport charges, for rs. 9, 7l, 030 on account of payments made to the company directly and for rupees 4, 95, 060 on account of price of steel supplied to the company. the arbitrator also found that the appellant had deducted rs. 3, 57, 500 from bills of the company on account of the price of steel and upon that finding the arbitrator subtracted the sum of rs. 3, 57, 500 from the price of steel credited to the appellant.
3. the appellant thereafter applied to the calcutta high court for setting aside the award or the ground that there was an error of law apparent on the face of the award and the arbitrator had also exceeded his authority in awarding interest. the application was dismissed by mallick, j. by his judgment, dated july 27, 1960 and a decree was granted to the company on the basis of the award. the appellant preferred two appeals to the high court from the judgment of mallick, j., namely, appeals nos. 32 and 132 of 1961 these appeals were heard by the division bench consisting of bachawat and laik, jj. who allowed the appeal in part and reduced the principal amount adjudged to be payable under the award by rs. 30, 970 and modified the award accordingly.
4. the first question to be considered in these appeals is whether the arbitrator committed an error of law in holding that the appellant had deducted rs. 3, 57, 500 from the bills of the company with regard to contract other than the three contracts of bedsteads which are the subject-matter of the present case, and whether the arbitrator could subtract the aforesaid amount of rs. 3, 57, 500 from the price of steel credited to the appellant. on behalf of the appellant it was contended by mr. bindra that the deduction of rs. 3, 57, 500 had been made from the bills submitted by the company for the price of the bedsteads supplied under the three contracts nos. a.t. 3116, a.t. no. 767 and a.t. 816 and the arbitrator should not have debited the appellant with this amount. it is not possible for us to accept this argument. the award of the arbitrator does not show on its face that the amount of rs. 3, 57, 500 has been deducted from the bills submitted by the company for the price of the bedsteads under the three contracts. the relevant portion of the award states :
.
there were conflicting statements of the parties in the affidavits filed by them before mallick, j. in connection with the application for setting aside the award. the affidavit filed by the appellant, dated january 5, 1957 before the arbitrator suggests that at least part of the deductions were made from bills submitted by the company in other contracts. on behalf of the appellant mr. bindra referred to the affidavits and the statements made before the arbitrator, but it is well settled that the court has no. jurisdiction to investigate into the merits of the case and to examine the documentary and oral evidence on the record for the purpose of finding out whether or not the arbitrator has committed an error of law and that the award of the arbitrator can be set aside on the ground of error of law on the face of the award only when in the award or in a document incorporated with it, as for instance a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his decision, there is found some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous. in the present case, the affidavits filed by the parties before the arbitrator are not incorporated in the award and it is, therefore, not permissible for the court to examine these affidavits in order to ascertain whether the arbitrator has committed any error of law. in hodgkinson v. fernie, (1857) 3 cb (ns) 189 at p. 202, the law on this point has been clearly stated by william, j. as follows :
