facts
2. on 18th march, 1997, reliance had entered into bso interconnect agreement with department of telecommunications (dot) for interconnection of their networks within their respective circles. in october, 2000, with its establishment, the bsnl took over from dot the aforementioned bso agreement. in november, 2003, the bso regime was replaced by unified access services regime which granted the licence to service providers for both basic and mobile telephony services as part of a single unified licence. reliance was allowed to operate as a unified access service provider from november 14, 2003 though it was formally granted the unified access service licence on 21st september, 2004 with effect from 14th november, 2003. by an addenda dated 28th february, 2006, the agreement was formally amended with retrospective effect from 14th november, 2003. the agreement deals with local calls, national long distance calls (nldc) and international long distance calls (ild). calls of each trunk group are connected through dedicated ports and are chargeable at rates different from other trunk groups. hence, depending on the number of calls handled by a particular port, charges are levied by bsnl on reliance, at the rate of the existing call charges payable for that particular trunk group.
3. on 24th june, 2003, the dot issued a circular specifying that calling line identification (cli) cannot be tampered with under any circumstances and also gave directions to service providers on how to prevent such tampering. by its circular dated 28th january, 2004, the above circular of dot coupled with
dated 29th october, 2003 issued by telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) was made effective.
4. in september, 2004, bsnl received several complaints from its subscribers in gujarat that they were receiving ild calls with local cli numbers. on the basis of these reports, bsnl made its own enquiries by calling the local cli number, i.e., 0281-3041000. this was on 5th october, 2004, 6th october, 2004 and 7th october, 2004. each time the number was called the response from the other end was that the number did not exist. therefore, on 8th october, 2004, bsnl reported the matter to reliance at which time reliance had sent its report to dot regarding the same. in the said report to dot, reliance stated that the wrong routing of ild calls was being done by one of its subscribers, viz., m/s. raj enterprises (who was given 60 calls circuits). the series of numbers allotted to raj enterprises was from 2813041000 - 2813041199, i.e., 200 numbers.
5. on 13th october, 2004, bsnl gave notice to reliance saying that reliance is having pois at various exchanges in vadodra; that on monitoring incoming traffic to bsnl as indicated in cdrs at the above pois, it was found that there were numerous calls with cli as 281 3041000; that, such calls have been received from 4th september, 2004 and, therefore, bsnl will charge at rs. 5.65 per minute for all incoming calls at poi of reliance from july, 2004. it may be noted that rs. 5.65 per minute is the rate of incoming isd calls at tax poi of reliance (the word 'tax' stands for trunk automatic exchange).
7. on 21st march, 2005, bsnl raised its bill on reliance (ril) levying "penalty" of rs. 9,17,27,746 with interest from 15th october, 2004 to 15th april, 2005 at 21% p.a. for months of july, 2004 to october, 2004 in all amounting to rs. 9,89,68,892/- for illegal routing of calls. this bill dated 21st march, 2005 superseded the provisional bill dated 15th october, 2004 raised by the vadodra unit of bsnl for rs. 6.89 cr. for the said period july, 2004 to september, 2004. in the said bill, the rate applied was rs. 5.65 per minute. this demand was made on the basis that numerous calls have been detected in the poi with cli as 281 3041000 which pertained to isdnb pri connection given to m/s. raj enterprises of rajkot. according to reliance, the calls received in its pois were "grey market" calls. that, they were neither wrongly routed nor their clis were tampered. ultimately, after detailed correspondence between bsnl and reliance, petition no. 275 of 2009 was filed by reliance against the above impugned demand.
8. by the impugned judgment, tdsat has held that the impugned demand of bsnl under clause 6.4.6 of the interconnect agreement is penal in nature; that under the said clause unauthorized calls had to be detected by bsnl and that in case of such detection charges were to be levied on such calls at the highest applicable iuc; that bsnl was under an obligation to draw distinction between unauthorized calls and calls without/ modified cli in the impugned demand which in the present case has not been done; that no opportunity of hearing was given to reliance and, lastly, the amount of penalty was not commensurate with actual damage suffered by bsnl. accordingly, the impugned demand was set aside. aggrieved by the impugned judgment of tdsat dated 24th may, 2010, bsnl has come to this court by this civil appeal.
