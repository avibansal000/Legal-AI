the judgment was delivered by : hon'ble justice d. k. jain
3. upon consideration of the affidavit filed in opposition by the state government, the high court felt that in the background of the case it had strong reservations about the impartiality and fairness in the investigation by the state police because of the political fallout, therefore, no useful purpose would be served in continuing with the investigation by the state investigating agency. moreover, even if the investigation was conducted fairly and truthfully by the state police, it would still be viewed with suspicion because of the allegation that all the assailants were members of the ruling party. having regard to all these circumstances, the high court deemed it appropriate to hand over the investigation into the said incident to the cbi.
