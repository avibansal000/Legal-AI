the judgment was delivered by
mathew, j.
in view of the definition of the word "business" in section 2 of the
(act no. 29 of 1954), as introduced with retrospective effect by the
(act no. 9 of 1965), the high court held that the sales of unserviceable materials were exigible to tax. the definition of the term "dealer" in section 2(f) of the above act, so far as it is material, runs :
as already indicated by section 2 of the
(act no. 9 of 1965), section 2 of the
(rajasthan act no. 29 of 1954), was amended. clause (cc) of section 2 provides :
the contention of the appellant was that it was not carrying on the business of buying and selling and therefore the sales of unserviceable material and scrap-iron, etc., would not be a transaction in connection with or incidental or ancillary to "such" trade, commerce, manufacture, adventure or concern.
we think that the activity of the appellant in the selling of unserviceable material and scrap-iron, etc., would be "business" within clause (i) of the definition of the word "business" introduced by the amending act. the word "business" according to clause (i) of that definition would include any trade, commerce, or manufacture or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade, commerce or manufacture whether or not it is carried on with a motive to make gain or profit. so even if it be assumed that the activity involved in selling unserviceable material and scrap-iron, etc., would not amount to carrying on business in the normal connotation of that term, it would be "business" within clause (i) of that sub-clause as introduced by the amending act.
in any view we are of the opinion that the high court was right in its conclusion.
we, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.
