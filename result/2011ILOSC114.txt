3. on 4.10.1998, at about 8.55 a.m., v. rajagopalaiah was crossing the road near ashraya hotel, b.m. road, channapatna, when a maruti van (owned by the first respondent) bearing registration no. ka-05-a-2535 came at a high speed and dashed against the deceased, causing severe injuries. he was taken to hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries.
4. the deceased was of 53 years of age and was survived by his wife and three sons, the present appellants. they filed a claim petition under section 166 of the
claiming rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. it was contested by the respondents.
5. motor accident claims tribunal (hereinafter "mact") found that the death of v. rajagopalaiah was due to the rash and negligent driving of the van driver (the second respondent). the deceased was working as senior assistant in karnataka electricity board (hereinafter "keb") and his last drawn gross monthly salary was rs.15,642/- i.e. rs.1,87,704/- annually. 1/3rd was deducted for personal expenses, after which the amount came to rs.1,25,136/-. as deceased was 53 years of age, a multiplier of 11 was applied. the tribunal also awarded funeral and transport expenses amounting to rs.10,000/-, medical expenses prior to death was rs.6,000 and compensation for loss and affection at rs.25,000/-. accordingly, total compensation awarded was rs.14,27,496/- along with interest of 9% p.a.

7. assailing the same, the appellants contend that the future prospects of the deceased and revision in salary were not taken into consideration by the high court and a split multiplier should not have been adopted.
9. in the sarla verma
10. the present case stands on different factual basis where there is clear and incontrovertible evidence on record that the deceased was entitled and in fact bound to get a rise in income in the future, a fact which was corroborated by evidence on record. thus, we are of the view that the present case comes within the 'exceptional circumstances' and not within the purview of rule of thumb laid down by the sarla verma
11. we base our conclusion on our findings from the records of the case. the evidence of pw.1, the son of the deceased, is that there are four claimants, three of them are the sons of the deceased and the other claimant is paternal grand-mother. therein, he stated that the deceased was the only bread earner of the family. it was stated by pw.1 that if his father, the deceased, would have been alive he could have got promotion and could have received the salary of rs.20,000/- per month.
12. pw.3, who was the senior assistant in keb, in his evidence also stated that the deceased was 52 years of age at the time of his death and he was having six years of service left. the annual increment is rs.350/-. in the year 2003 (which would have been year of retirement), the basic pay of the deceased would have been around rs.16,000/- and in all he would have obtained gross salary of rs.20,000/- per month. pw.3 deposed that as per the board agreement for every five years their pay revision is compulsory. both the witnesses were cross- examined before the tribunal but the evidence leading to pay revision was not assailed.
13. therefore, the consistent evidence before the tribunal was that if the deceased would have been alive he would have reached the gross salary of rs.20,000/- per month.
14.
15.
16. the income of the deceased will be taken to be rs.20,000/- p.m. which amounts to rs.2,40,000/- p.a. after deduction of 1/3rd amount for personal expenses, the loss of notional income will be rs.1,60,000/-. the multiplier of 11 will be applied, from which the loss of dependency will amount to rs.17,60,000/-. we also award rs.10,000/- for funeral and transport expenses, rs.6,000/- for medical expenses prior to death and rs.25,000/- for loss of love and affection. thus, the total compensation awarded amounts to rs.18,01,000/- which we round off to rs.18,00,000/-.
17. the amount of compensation would thus be rs.18,00,000/- with the rate of interest as granted by the tribunal. the amount is to be deposited with the tribunal within six weeks from date after deducting any amount, if already deposited.
18. the appeals are, thus, allowed. no costs.
