2. by order dated 24.1.2005, the appellant was promoted to the post of technical assistant grade-i by the respondents. the said promotion was cancelled by office order dated 23.3.2005 and he was continued in the pre-promotional post of technical assistant grade-ii. no. reasons werey assigned in the order dated 23.3.2005 for cancelling the promotion. nor was the appellant heard before cancellation of the promotion. feeling aggrieved, the appellant approached the high court in cwp no. 5026/2005 for quashing the cancellation dated 23.3.2005. the high court, by order dated 16.2.2006, allowed the writ petition and quashed the cancellation order dated 23.3.2005, as being opposed to principles of natural justice. liberty was reserved to the respondents to pass fresh orders in accordance with law, by observing the rules of natural justice, if so advised.
3. thereafter, the respondents reconsidered the matter and passed an order dated 20.4.2006. the said order stated that when the case of the appellant was considered for promotion on 8.11.2004, the zonal promotion committee had by inadvertence, without noticing the pendency of a minor penalty proceeding (initiated by issue of a charge-sheet dated 9.6.2004), had recommended his promotion; that in pursuance of it, the order of promotion was issued on 31.1.2005; that the said minor penalty proceeding was decided on 3.1.2005 holding him guilty and imposing a penalty of token recovery of rs. 5,000/-; that as the minor penalty proceedings was pending when his case was considered for promotion, he could not have been recommended for promotion; and that therefore, his order of promotion was rightly cancelled. the said order directed that, his case shall be placed before the next zonal promotion committee.
4. the appellant challenged the said order dated 20.4.2006 in another writ petition (c.w.p. no. 7637/2006). during the pendency of the said writ petition, the first respondent passed another order dated 11.3.2008 stating that the case of the appellant for consideration for promotion to the post of technical assistant grade-i was placed before the zonal promotion committee during 2005, 2006, and 2007 and the recommendations of zonal promotion committee were kept in a sealed cover due to his involvement in vigilance cases as reported by the zonal office. in view of the said order dated 11.3.2008, the high court dismissed his writ petition (cwp no. 7637/2006) by order dated 25.3.2008. it held that the stand of the respondents taken in the order dated 11.3.2008 in regard to sealed cover procedure being followed in the case of appellant was not unfair or unjust. the said order is challenged in this appeal by special leave.
5. the appellant does not dispute the fact that when his case was initially considered for promotion in december, 2004, a minor penalty proceeding was pending. nor does he dispute the fact that in the said proceedings, an order was made on 3.1.2005 imposing a penalty, for recovery of rs. 5,000/-. but the appellant relies on two circulars of the first respondent dated 13.12.2001 and 19.12.2001. the first circular dated 13.12.2001, reads thus:
