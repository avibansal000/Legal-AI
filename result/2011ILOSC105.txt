the judgment was delivered by : hon'ble justice a. k. patnaik
these two appeals are against two separate but identical orders passed by a division bench of the high court of delhi on 22.05.2003 in c.w. no.4555 of 2002 and c.w. no.4556 of 2002.
2. initially, promotions from one grade to the higher grade were made on the basis of seniority to the 2/3rd of the posts and on the basis of departmental examination to the 1/3rd of the posts. with effect from 30.11.1983, the government of india, ministry of communications, department of telecommunications (for short 'the government') introduced one time bound promotion scheme under which regular employees, who had completed sixteen years of service in a grade, were placed in the next higher grade. thereafter, by a circular dated 16.10.1990 the government introduced a new scheme known as 'biennial cadre review' (for short 'the bcr scheme'). under the bcr scheme, those employees, who were on regular service as on 01.01.1990 and had completed 26 years of satisfactory service in the basic grades, were to be screened by a duly constituted committee to assess their performance and determine their suitability for advancement and if they were found suitable they were to be upgraded in the higher scale.
the circular dated 16.10.1990, however, limited such upgradation to 10% of the posts in the lower pay-scale and the review of the cadres for the purpose of such upgradation was to take place once in two years. the government then issued clarifications on some points in its letter dated 11.03.1991 on the bcr scheme.
point no.10 and the clarification thereon in the letter dated 11.03.1991 are quoted hereunder:-
4. some officers of grade iii who were senior in the basic grade but had lost their seniority in grade iii because of their later promotions and who were not considered for upgradation to grade iv under the bcr scheme, namely, smt. santosh kapoor and others, filed o.a. no.1455 of 1991 before the central administrative tribunal, new delhi, contending on the basis of clarification on point no.10 made in the letter dated 11.0.3.1991 that under the bcr scheme, seniority in the basic grade was to be counted for the purpose of upgradation on completion of 26 years of service and this contention was resisted by the government and other respondents in the o.a. and the tribunal in its order dated 07.07.1992 directed that promotions of 10% posts in the scale of rs.2000-3200 (grade iv) would have to be based on seniority in the basic grade subject to fulfillment of other conditions in the bcr scheme and further directed the government to consider the applicants in the o.a. from due dates with consequential benefits. in the order dated 07.07.1992, the tribunal, however, observed that employees who may be senior to the applicants in the o.a. in the scale of rs.1600-2660 (grade iii) and who may have already been given the scale of rs.2000-3200 (grade iv) at the cost of those who were senior in the basic grades by any different interpretation of the bcr scheme, may in the discretion of the government instead of being reverted, be considered for promotion to scale of rs.2000-3200 (grade iv) by suitable adjustments in the number of posts by upgradation as necessary. the government challenged the order dated 07.07.1992 of the tribunal in civil appeal no.3201 of 1993 but by order dated 09.09.1993 this court held that the direction by the tribunal cannot be faulted and accordingly dismissed the appeal.
5. pursuant to the order dated 07.07.1992 of the tribunal in o.a. no.1455 of 1991 as affirmed by this court in civil appeal no.3201 of 1993, supernumerary posts were created in the scale of rs.2000-3200 (grade iv) to adjust the employees who had already been given the scale of rs.2000-3200 on the basis of their seniority in the scale of rs.1600-2660 (grade iii). moreover, after a review of the procedure for promotions from grade iii to grade iv, the government issued a fresh circular dated 13.12.1995 saying that promotion to grade-iv may be given from amongst officials in grade-iii on the basis of their seniority in the basic grade, subject to fitness determined by the dpc and subject to the ceiling of 10% of the posts in grade-iii (scale rs.1600-2660) as provided in the bcr scheme.
6. the respondents in c.a. no.4369 of 2006 shri ghanshyam dass and others filed o.a. no.2484 of 1997 and the respondents in c.a. no.4370 of 2006 shri chiddu singh and others filed o.a. no.2099 of 1997 before the central administrative tribunal contending that employees who were juniors to them in the basic grade but otherwise senior in grade-iii, had been given promotion to grade-iv earlier to the dates when the respondents were given such promotion and by a common order dated 11.08.2000 the tribunal allowed the o.as. and directed the government to consider promoting them to grade iv with effect from the dates their immediate juniors in the basic grade seniority were so promoted subject to their otherwise being found fit for promotion on such dates with consequential benefits including seniority and arrears of pay and allowances and retiral benefits in the case of those who had retired on superannuation. the government filed writ petitions c.w. no.4555 of 2000 and c.w. no.4556 of 2000 in the high court of delhi, but by the two separate impugned orders the high court found that the tribunal, while allowing the applications, had directed the government to follow its own circular dated 13.12.1995 which had been issued pursuant to the order of the tribunal dated 07.07.1992 in o.a. no.1455 of 1991 which had attained finality after dismissal of the appeals by this court and accordingly dismissed the two writ petitions.
7. when these two civil appeals were heard by a two judge bench of this court on 14.03.2007, they were of the view that the matter should be referred to a larger bench for the reasons stated in the order dated 14.03.2007, which are quoted hereinunder:
thus, the learned judges were of the view that on account of the order passed by central administrative tribunal in o.a. no. 1455 of 1991 which had been affirmed by this court on 09.09.1993 in c.a. no. no.3201 of 1993 an anomalous situation has been created inasmuch as a person who is in grade i and had put in 26 years of service would be entitled for promotion from grade i to grade iv. they were of the view that the concept of basic cadre has to be interpreted with reference to the seniority in each grade. 8. in the course of hearing before us, however, it has been brought to our notice by learned counsel for the parties that the controversy before us is confined to promotions of only employees from grade-iii to grade-iv and not of employees working in either grade-i or grade-ii. this will be clear from the order dated 07.07.1992 of the central administrative tribunal in o.a. no.1455 of 1991 [smt. santosh kapoor and others v. union of india and others] in which the tribunal has directed that promotions to 10% posts in grade-iv (pay scale 2000-3200) would have to be based on seniority in basic cadres subject to fulfillment of other conditions in the bcr scheme and it is this order of the tribunal which was affirmed by this court in the order dated 09.09.1993 in civil appeal no.3201 of 1993. this will also be clear from the fresh circular dated 13.12.1995 which was confined to promotions from grade iii to grade iv under the bcr scheme. hence, the question of an employee of the basic grade (grade-i) being promoted to grade-iv directly does not arise in the appeals before us.
