the judgment was delivered by : hon'ble justice s. h. kapadia
1. leave granted.
2. the issue involved in this batch of civil appeals, by special leave, filed by the department relates to the question whether mat credit admissible in terms of section 115jaa has to be set off against the tax payable (assessed tax) before calculating interest under sections 234a, b and c of the
(the act).
3. at the outset, it may be stated that there is no dispute in regard to eligibility of the assessee for set off of tax paid under section 115ja. the dispute is only in regard to priority of adjustment for the mat credit.
5. as per provisions of section 115ja, a company is liable to pay tax on 30% of book profits, if the income computed under normal provisions of
is less than 30% of the book profits. thus, the assessee is required to compute income chargeable to tax on two alternative basis - (i) income computed under normal provisions of
and (ii) 30% of book profits as disclosed in the p & l account prepared in accordance with parts ii and iii of schedule vi to the
, as defined in section 2(43). [see national thermal power corpn. ltd. v. union of india 192 itr 187
6. the relevant provisions under section 115jaa of
, introduced by
w.e.f. 1.4.1997, i.e., applicable for assessment years 1997-98 and onwards, governing the carry forward and set off of credit available in respect of tax paid under section 115ja, show that when tax is paid by the assessee under section 115ja, then the assessee becomes entitled to claim credit of such tax in the manner prescribed. such a right gets crystallized no sooner the tax is paid by the assessee under section 115ja, as per the return of income filed by that assessee for a previous year (say, year one). [see section 115jaa(1)]. the said credit gets limited to the tax difference between tax payable on book profits and tax payable on income computed under the normal provisions of
less the tax payable on book profits for that year. [refer section 115jaa(4) and section 115jaa(5)]. the tax credit to be allowed is the function of the tax payable on book profits and the tax payable on income computed under the normal provisions of
, in year one. as stated, the difference of the two is the amount of tax credit to be allowed. the a.o. may vary the amount of tax credit to be allowed pursuant to completion of summary assessment under section 143(1) or regular assessment under section 143(3) for year one, in terms of section 115jaa(6). as a consequence of such variation the tax credit to be allowed for year one is liable to change. with every change in the amount of tax payable on book profits and/ or tax payable on income computed under the normal provisions of
, the tax credit to be allowed would have to be changed by the a.o. by passing consequential orders, deriving authority from section 115jaa(6) of
. thus, the tax credit allowable can be set off by the assessee while computing advance tax/ self-assessment tax payable for years 2 to 6 limited to the difference between the tax payable on income computed under the normal provisions and tax payable on book profits in each of those years, as per assessee's own computation. although the right to avail tax credit gets crystallized in year one, on payment of tax under section 115ja and the set off thereof follows statutorily, the amount of credit available and the amount of set off to be actually allowed as in all cases of deductions/ allowances under sections 30- 37, is fluid/ inchoate and subject to final determination only on adjudication of assessment either under section 143(1) or under section 143(3). the fact that the amount of tax credit to be allowed or to be set off is not frozen and is ambulatory, does not take away/ destroy the right of the assessee to the amount of tax credit.
8. the effect of the stand of the department is as follows: in titan's case, the assessee files its returns for assessment year 2001-02. the total income declared in the return was '23,48,68,460/-. the assessee claimed a refund of '10,60,394/-. the a.o. initially processed the return under section 143(1) and accepted it. subsequently, the a.o. rectified the alleged mistake and charged interest under section 234b of '1,10,67,561/-. the a.o. further charged interest under section 234c of '40,18,170/-. this levy of interest took place because the a.o. took the view that credit of the tax paid under section 115ja(1) was to be given in terms of section 115jaa only after computing the interest to be charged under sections 234b and c. the result was that claim for refund in favour of the assessee of an amount of '10,60,394/- having regard to the pre-paid taxes got converted into the demand by department of '1,50,58,707/- after giving full credit for the prepaid taxes only because the a.o. gave a set off of mat credit in the sum of '5,40,15,189/- not against the total tax payable of '7,75,03,252/- but against the total tax payable of '7,75,03,252/- minus tds and advance tax paid by the assessee resulting in the figure of '5,39,88,163/- being the balance tax payable by the assessee plus interest under section 234b and under section 234c in all amounting to '6,90,73,894/- from which the a.o. deducts the mat credit of '5,40,15,189/-. consequently, under the computation of the assessee no tax was payable whereas under the computation, assessee became liable to pay tax of '1,50,58,707/-. this conversion from refund to demand took place because while computing interest under sections 234b and c the a.o. computed the shortfall of the tax payable without taking into account the set off of mat credit.
for sake of clarity, we set out the above facts in the case of m/s. titan industries limited in the form of a chart:
9. we have discussed hereinabove the scheme of section 115ja(1) and section 115jaa.
11. to answer, we need to look at section 234b. under that section, "assessed tax" means the tax on the total income determined under section 143(1) or on regular assessment under section 143(3) as reduced by the amount of tax deducted or collected at source in accordance with the provisions of chapter xvii on any income which is subject to such deduction or collection and which is taken into account in computing such total income. the definition, thus, at the relevant time excluded mat credit for arriving at assessed tax. this led to immense hardship. the position which emerged was that due to omission on one hand mat credit was available for set off for five years under section 115jaa but the same was not available for set off while calculating advance tax. this dichotomy was more spelt out because section 115jaa did not provide for payment of interest on the mat credit. to avoid this situation, parliament amended explanation 1 to section 234b by
w.e.f. 1.4.2007 to provide along with tax deducted or collected at source, mat credit under section 115jaa also to be excluded while calculating assessed tax.
13. lastly, it is immaterial that the relevant form prescribed under
at the relevant time (i.e. before 1.4.2007), provided for set off of mat credit balance against the amount of tax plus interest i.e. after the computation of interest under section 234b. this was directly contrary to a plain reading of section 115jaa(4). further, a form prescribed under the rules can never have any effect on the interpretation or operation of the parent statute.
14. for the above reasons, there is no merit in the civil appeals filed by the department and the same are dismissed with no order as to costs.
