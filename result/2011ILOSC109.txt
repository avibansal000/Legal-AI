.
2. in regard to acquisition of land belonging to the respondents, the reference court by judgment dated 5.3.2001 awarded compensation at the rate of rs.6,96,000/- per acre alongwith statutory benefits under section 23(1a), 23(2) and 28 of
. the respondents filed an execution application wherein they claimed additional amount of 12% per annum for the period 11.11.1993 to 16.6.1994 (that is from the date of notification under section 4(1) of
till the date of the award) under section 23(1a) of
, not only on the market value of the land, but also on the solatium amount. the said claim was accepted by the executing court by order dated 8.5.2008. the revision filed by the appellant was rejected by the high court on 4.9.2008. the said revisional order of the high court is challenged in this appeal by special leave.
dealing with matters to be considered in determining compensation. the said provision is extracted below:
4. section 23 of
refers to four distinct amounts:
(i) market value of the land on the date of publication of the notification under section 4(1) of
is first and foremost of the six factors to be taken note of for determining the amount of compensation for the land acquired. it is the major component (and in most cases, the only component) of the compensation determined by the court under section 23(1) of
.
(ii) compensation to be awarded to a person for the acquired land, is to be determined under section 23(1) of
(iv) solatium at 30% on such market value, in consideration of the compulsory nature of acquisition.
while market value and compensation are factors to be assessed and determined by the court, no such judicial exercise is involved in regard to additional amount payable under section 23(1a) and solatium payable under section 23(2) as they are statutory benefits payable automatically at the rates specified in those sub-sections, qua the market price. no reasons need be assigned for grant of additional amount or solatium.
5. this court explained the object of granting additional amount under section 23(1a) of
in assistant commissioner, gadag sub-division, gadag v. mathapathi basavannewwa (1995) 6 scc 355
in l. krishnan
in p.ram reddy v. land acquisition officer (1995) 2 scc 305
was payable only on the market value determined under section 23(1) of
, thereby clearly implying that it was not reckonable on any other amount:
in sunder v. union of india (2001) 7 scc 211
would include not only the compensation determined by taking note of the six factors mentioned in section 23(1) of
, but also amounts awarded under the remaining sub-sections of section 23 as well, for the purpose of calculating interest. the words 'compensation to be awarded' used in section 23(1) of
refers to the total of the sums awarded with reference to the six factors enumerated in section 23(1). on the other hand, the words 'amount awarded' or 'sum awarded' in sections 28 and 34 of
refers to the aggregate of the compensation determined by the court under section 23(1), the additional amount payable under section 23(1a) and the solatium payable under section 23(2) of
.
6.
7. thus a person whose land is acquired is entitled to the following amounts under
.
(a) compensation determined under section 23(1) of
(comprising the market value of the land referred to as the first factor and any damages/expenses referred to as the second to sixth factors under the said sub-section).
(b) solatium at 30% on the market value determined as the first factor under section 23(1) of
.
(c) additional amount at 12% per annum of the market value of the land referred to as the first factor under section 23(1) of
, for the period specified in section 23(2).
payments made are to be adjusted and accounted in the manner set out in gurpreet singh v. union of india (2006) 8 scc 457
