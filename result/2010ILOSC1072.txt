2. in all these appeals, the respondent-importers had imported ships for breaking purposes under respective memorandums of agreements (moa) on a lump sum price. however, subsequently addendums were entered into between the sellers of the ship and the importers reducing the negotiated price on account of certain shortcomings and missing parts. the short controversy is whether or not the reduced price mentioned in the addendum has any bearing on the determination of the value of the ship for the afore-stated purpose. to appreciate the rival stands, it would be expedient to state the facts in civil appeal no. 147/2004 as illustrative, with brief reference to the material details in each of the other appeals, in the latter part of this order.
3. the importer viz. m/s. rai metal works imported an old vessel under an moa dated 27th january 1999 with m/s. sea crest shipping inc. per the moa, the purchase price of the said vessel was agreed upon at us $ 5,09,190.50 at the rate of us $ 108.50 per long ton and the light displacement tonnage (ldt) of the vessel was represented at 4693 long tons. as per clause 1 of the moa, the vessel was to be delivered "at the outer anchorage with available outfit, equipment anchors and chains in safely afloat condition, free of charter, free of cargo on the basis of delivery under own power." the said clause provided for price adjustment only in case of difference between actual ldt and agreed ldt. clause 7 of the moa provided that the seller makes no representations or warranties of any kind, except for what was provided in clauses 11 and 19 of the agreement. clause 19 provided the description of the vessel, and noted the power of the main generator at 450 kw. clause 11 stipulated the period of notice to the importer on the vessel entering the outer- anchorage at alang (gujarat).

5. the vessel arrived at the alang anchorage on 15th february 1999. the survey report was submitted on 16th february 1999, and it stated that the said vessel arrived under tow. the bill of entry was filed on 19th february 1999, wherein the importer disclosed the reduced price of the vessel as per the addendum. in the said bill of entry, the reason for reduction of price was shown as "major discrepancy found in the generator of captioned vessel was not in working condition."
6. a provisional assessment was made on 19th february 2000 at the reduced price mentioned in the addendum, and differential duty of 2,87,441/- was levied. the final assessment order was passed by the deputy commissioner, customs division, bhavnagar on 17th april 2001, at the original transaction value of the vessel at us $ 5,09,190.50, confirming the differential duty of 2,87,141.
