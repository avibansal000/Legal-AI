the judgment was delivered by : hon'ble justice r. v. raveendran
1. an area of 3,65,375 sq.m. of land in balli village, quepem taluk, goa was acquired for laying the new broad gauge line for konkan railway in pursuance of preliminary notification dated 27.6.1991 (published on 30.7.1991) and final declaration dated 4.11.1991. the acquisition included parts of survey nos. 45/1, 45/5, 45/6, 51/1 and 51/2 of balli village measuring 60343 sq.m. (for short the 'acquired lands') belonging to the appellant. the land acquisition collector, by his award dated 7.12.1993, awarded compensation at the rate of rs.12/- per sq.m. for bharad (orchard) lands and rs.6/- per sq.m. for irrigated (paddy) lands. the reference court and the high court affirmed the said valuation by rejecting the reference and appeal by the appellant. the refusal to increase the compensation is under challenge in this appeal by special leave. the only question that arises for consideration is whether compensation awarded, should have been at a higher rate.
description, location and potential of the land
3. the high court has also referred to the situation of the property and has noted that the acquired lands are in a village where all basic amenities like primary health centre, high school, post office were available within a distance of 500 meters. it can therefore be safely concluded that the acquired lands are not undeveloped rural land, but can be urbanisable land situated near a developed semi-urban village with access to all infrastructure facilities.
basis of compensation awarded
4. the land acquisition collector has relied upon two sale transactions in his award to arrive at the market value of the acquired lands.
4.1 the first is a sale deed dated 30.8.1989 relating to sale of 2055 sq.m. of land in survey no.83 which is situated at a distance of 200 m. from the acquired lands which was sold at the rate of rs.43.80 per sq.m. the award states that the land sold under the deed dated 30.8.1989 is a developed bharad type of land with approach road. therefore it is similar to the acquired lands. the description of the land and the extent of the land sold, make it clear that what was sold was an orchard land and not a residential plot. to arrive at the market value of the acquired land, the land acquisition collector deducted 45% from the sale price of rs.43.80 per sq.m., towards 'development cost', i.e. providing approach roads and open spaces, expenses relating to development work, conversion charges etc. he thus arrived at the value of the undeveloped plot as rs.24 per sq.m. as there was a gap of 23 months between the date of the said sale and the date of preliminary notification in this case, the collector provided a cumulative increase at the rate of 14.5% per annum over the said rs.24/- to arrive at the market value as on 30.7.1991 as rs.32.24 per sq.m.
4.2) the second sale deed relied upon by the collector is dated 30.1.1990 and related to the sale of 7600 sq.m. of land in survey no.77 of balli village situated at a distance of one km from the acquired land, sold at the rate of rs.3 per sq.m. as there was a gap of about 18 months between the date of the said sale deed and the date of preliminary notification, the collector provided a cumulative rate of 14.5% per annum over rs.3/- and arrived at the market value on 30.7.1991 as rs.3.82 per sq.m.
5. the collector next averaged the said two rates derived from the sale prices under the two sale deeds (that is, rs.32.24 per sq.m. and rs.3.82 sq.m.) and arrived at the market value for bharad type of land as rs.18 per sq.m. however, as the collector had separately valued and awarded compensation for the trees (that is rs.24,14,677/- for the entire 3,65,375 per sq.m. acquired) he was of the view that the average value of trees per sq.m. would be around rs.6/- and that should be deducted from the said market value of rs. 18 per sq.m. he thus awarded compensation at the rate of rs.12 per sq.m. for the bharad land. thereafter he determined the rate of paddy lands as rs.6/- per sq.m.
the appellant's claim
6. the appellant contended that the market value determined by the land acquisition collector was very low and sought compensation at the rate of rs.250/- per sq.m. the appellant contended that the reference court and the high court had erroneously rejected the evidence produced, that is three comparable sales which showed that the market value was much more. the three exemplar sale deeds relied upon by the land owner relating to the said village were: (i) sale deed dated 6.1.1989 under which an extent of 2000 sq.m. land with trees was sold at a rate of rs.100/- per sq.m.; (ii) sale deed dated 7.3.1991 whereby 896 sq.m. of land at a distance of 300 m. from the acquired lands was sold at a price of rs.150/- per sq.m.; (iii) sale deed dated 3.4.1991 whereby 300 sq.m. of land situated at a distance of 200 meter was sold at a price of rs.221.66 per sq.m. the respondents, on the other hand, contended that the three exemplars were rightly rejected and the valuation by the land acquisition collector was rightly upheld.
valuation of the acquired lands
7. the appellant examined the purchasers under the sale deeds dated 7.3.1991 (ex.aw 1/c) and 3.4.1991((ex.aw 1/d). the purchaser in regard to sale deed dated 6.1.1989 was not examined. however, the power of attorney holder of the appellant (aw-1) has referred to the said sale deed dated 6.1.1989. on careful consideration, we find that the reference court and the high court have rightly refused to rely upon the said three sale deeds for determination of the market value of the acquired lands.
7.1) the first sale deed dated 6.1.1989 related to a sale by the owner of a land to his own company, that is, a private limited company of which he was the director. such a sale cannot normally be treated as an independent sale by a willing seller to a willing buyer. no one connected with the sale was examined to establish that it was a sale at market value. this sale was therefore rightly rejected.
7.2) the second sale deed dated 7.3.1991 was in respect of a small area measuring 28 m. x 32 m. (896 sq.m.) which was carved out of a residential property situated within the village abadi of balli, adjoining the government hospital. it was purchased for the purpose of construction of shop. the acquired lands are agricultural orchard lands situated away from the village abadi area. therefore the said sale deed does not relate to a comparable land.
7.3) the third sale deed dated 3.4.1991 also related to the sale of a part of a residential property in the village abadi area and related to a corner plot measuring 300 sq.m. situated at a distance of 50 m. from balli market. that sale also does not relate to a comparable land.

10.
11. the sale deed relied upon by the land acquisition collector was dated 30.8.1989. the relevant date for determination of compensation is 30.7.1991. having regard to the fact that acquired lands were in an urbanisable area with readily available infrastructural facilities, we are of the view that the cumulative increase of 14.5% per annum adopted by the collector in his award, would be appropriate. by providing such increase, for two years, we would be able to arrive at the market value of the acquired land as on the date of publication of the preliminary notification. by providing such appreciation at 14.5% for two years on the base price of rs.43.80 per sq.m. the market value as on 30.7.1991 for the acquired bharad lands would be rs.57.42, rounded of to rs.57.50 per sq.m.
12. the next question that arises for consideration is whether the compensation should be determined only with reference to the said sale deed dated 30.8.1989 or whether the other sale deed dated 31.1.1990 relied upon by the land acquisition collector, whereby 7600 sq.m. of land in sy.no. 77 at a distance of one kilometer was sold at the rate of rs.3/- per sq.m. should also be taken note of by averaging the two prices. as against the sale deed dated 30.8.1989 which was in regard to a land situated at a distance of 200 meters, the sale deed dated 31.1.1990 related to a land which was more than one kilometer away. there is nothing to show that it was similar bharad land. further the very fact that the first sale deed which is relied upon and accepted by the land acquisition collector as relating to a comparable land is at a price of rs.43.80 per sq.m., would demonstrate that the second sale deed showing a very low sale price of rs.3/- per sq.m. cannot be considered to be a comparable sale. when the second sale deed relied upon is at a rate which is only 1/15 th of the price disclosed by the first sale deed, obviously they are not comparable sales. further the award of the collector specifically states that the land sold under sale deed dated 30.8.1989 is a similar land, that is, a bharad land at a distance of 200 meter. significantly there is no such finding that the subject matter of the second sale dated 31.1.1990 which was one kilometer away, was a similarly situated land. the sale deed dated 31.1.1990 should therefore be inferred to be either an undervalued sale or a distress sale or at all events not a comparable sale. the land acquisition collector was not therefore justified in averaging the sale prices of the two sale deeds. once it is found that the first sale deed was in regard to a comparable land and the second sale deed was not in regard to a comparable land, the second sale deed dated 31.1.1990 ought to have been excluded from consideration.

13.1) in sri rani m. vijayalakshmanna rao bahadur, ranee of vuyyur vs. the collector of madras, 1969 (1) mlj 45
14. the land acquisition collector had valued the trees at rs.6/- per sq.m. to arrive at the value of the lands without trees. on that basis the market value of paddy land situated amidst the bharad land can be arrived at by deducting rs.6/- per sq.m. in the absence of any other evidence, we fix the said rate for paddy land on that basis, that is, rs.51.50 per sq.m.
conclusion
15. the appellant will thus be entitled to compensation at the rate of rs.57.50 per sq.m. in respect of bharad land without any additional or separate compensation for trees. the appellant will be entitled to compensation at the rate of rs.50/- per sq.m.
(i) the compensation for the acquired lands (bharad lands) is increased to rs.57.50 per sq.m. (instead of rs.12/- per sq.m. plus value of trees awarded by the lac) and rs.51.50 per sq.m. for paddy lands (as against rs.6/- per sq.m. awarded by the lac)
(ii) the respondent shall pay to the appellant, additional amount under section 23(1a) of
, at 12% per annum from 30.7.1991 to 17.3.1992 (date of taking possession) and solatium at 30% under section 23(2) of the said act, on the compensation amount.
(iii) the respondents shall pay to the appellant, interest at the rate of 9% per annum from 30.7.1991 for a period of one year and 15% per annum thereafter till date of deposit under section 28 of the said act on the amount awarded in excess of what was awarded by the land acquisition collector.
(iv) the award made in regard to structures is not disturbed.
(v) appellant will be entitled to costs throughout from the respondents.
