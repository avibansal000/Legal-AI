2. in this writ petition, the prayer was for issuance of the writ in the nature of mandamus directing the state of bihar to issue necessary notification under clause 24 of the 1995 policy. the claim of the company was that notification under clause 24 of the industrial policy, 1995 ought to have been issued within one month of the release/publication of the policy in september, 1995. voluminous record was produced before the high court in support of the submission that the company is entitled to exemption under the 1995 policy. the state of bihar contested the writ petition by filing a counter affidavit. supplementary counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the government through secretary-cum- commissioner, department of commercial taxes (respondent no.4 in the writ petition) on 05.12.2000. in paragraph 5 of the aforesaid affidavit it is stated as under:-

5. the high court considered the entire issue. the company as well as the state made detailed reference to the documents which were placed on the record. ultimately, the writ petition has been allowed. the decisions dated 06.01.2001 and 05.03.2001 have been quashed. further directions issued to the state government are as follows;
6. this decision has been challenged by the appellant-state.
7. at this stage it would be appropriate to notice the orders passed by this court during the proceedings. on 18.11.2002, following directions were issued:-
8. thereafter ia no.3 of 2006 was filed by the appellant seeking stay of the judgment of the high court, it has been stated that the application has been necessitated because of the intervening circumstances and the conduct of the company. it was further stated that pursuant to the direction issued by this court on 18.11.2002, the appellant issued notification no.so-174 dated 18.10.2004 granting exemption to the company. the notification was to have effect for five years from the date of publication in the official gazette or till the disposal of the special leave petition. the notification was issued on the following terms:-
9. thereafter the appellant requested the company to comply with the directions of this court. the company, however, informed the appellant that it was unable to comply with the directions because of its 'sickness'. since the company failed to comply with the aforesaid order, a prayer was made for recalling the same.
10. the company in its reply elaborately explained the efforts being made by the financial institutions to ensure the survival of the company. it reiterated that the company had acted honestly and in good faith on assurances/approval given by the appellant at various stages. the company continued with its operation in anticipation of receiving the appellant's approval at some point of time. had the appellant not given the assurances, the company could have suspended its operation. the government gave assurances and granted approval on 07.01.1998, 23.01.1998, 12.03.1998, 21.01.1999, 12.07.1999, 29.10.1999, 02.12.1999, 17.12.1999, 25.01.2000, 31.03.2000, 29.05.2000 and 30.06.2000. it was also pointed out that even the officers of the commercial taxes department including commissioner, commercial taxes to the effect that the notification was in the process of being issued. it was also pointed out that even after the vat regime being introduced, sales tax related incentives to industries are being given to industries by various states. in fact under the industrial policy 2003 as well as the industrial policy, 2006, sales tax incentives in some form or the other have been retained/provided. it is further pointed out that the notification dated 18.10.2004 was issued after expiry of two years from the date of the order passed by this court. the delayed action of the appellant practically crippled the company financially and jeopardized efforts for revival as the sales tax benefit is crucial for the company's revival and continued operations. it is reiterated that the company is entitled to get the benefit under the industrial policy, 1995. with regard to the non-deposit of the "amount equivalent to the sales tax payable by it as and when it becomes due". it is stated that the company had bona fide opened the bank account with a nationalized bank but could not deposit the amount equivalent to the sales tax due because of circumstances beyond its control.
11. during the pendency of the interim application, proposal for the approval of the reconstruction package of the company was under the active consideration of the state. therefore, the proceedings were adjourned from time to time.
12. during this period an application was also filed by the assets reconstruction company (i) ltd. for being impleaded as a party. the aforesaid application has been allowed by this court on 04.09.2006 and the applicant has been impleaded as respondent no.2.
13. we have heard the counsel for the parties. dr. rajiv dhawan and mr. dinesh dwivedi, senior advocates made the submissions on behalf of the appellant. dr. dhawan submits that in the aforesaid judgment the high court has held that:
i. the petitioner had a right to be granted sales tax exemption under 1995 industrial policy;
ii the decision of 6 january 2001 denying such exemption was arbitrary (which was challenged but alleged not to be on record);
iii. the decision of 5 march 2001 was wrong, even though not on record and not challenged.
14. according to dr. dhawan the high court has wrongly quashed the order dated 06.01.2001 on the basis that it was an arbitrary somersault after 05.12.2000. this conclusion is erroneous as the aforesaid order had given four cogent reasons in support of the decisions which have been duly noticed by the high court. the aforesaid reasons could not be said to be extraneous to the decision dated 06.01.2001. thereafter, it is submitted that the relevant rule/clauses 22 and 24 were wrongly interpreted because it stated "clause 22.2 of the policy would come into force after a notification under clause 24 is issued." the high court has wrongly held that the precondition of revival under clause 22 came into effect after the final decision under clause 24. according to the learned senior counsel the high court failed to notice that clause 22.2 was about revival of the company and not just granting sales tax exemptions. furthermore, clause 22.3 barred exemption/deferment to be given to such sick and closed industrial units which have once availed of such facilities in the past. this company has availed the deferment in the past and had not paid the sums due. it is then emphasized that clause 24 was a monitoring clause, but the time period of one month was simply a target. therefore, it was neither mandatory nor directory.
