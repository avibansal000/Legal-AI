(to be hereinafter referred to as "the act"). they challenge the assessment proceedings under the act for the assessment years 1968-69, 1969-70, 1970-71 and 1971-72 and contest the validity of section 3-ab of the act, which was incorporated into the act by the
(no. 20 of 1971). they contest the validity of that provision on various grounds. the high court rejected those contentions and dismissed the writ petition. hence this appeal.

(
. but the court held that the notifications did not fall within the purview of section 3-a as in the state of u.p., bricks were sold directly to the consumers by the manufacturers. the court opined that before section 3-a can be attracted, the goods in question must have been the subject-matter of multiple sales. it further held that the amendment effected by the 1970 ordinance was ineffective to save the notifications. thereafter the u.p. legislature passed the
