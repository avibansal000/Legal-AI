the judgment was delivered by : hon'ble justice surinder singh nijjar
1. these appeals are directed against the order passed by a division bench of the high court of judicature of andhra pradesh at hyderabad in cmp nos. 21114, 21115, 21116, 21117 and 21118 of 2003 dated 19th august, 2003. by the aforesaid order, the high court has allowed all the petitions/applications.
2. in the applications/petitions, respondent no.3, herein, had sought the following directions:-
3. we may now briefly notice the relevant facts as stated in the pleadings of the parties and the impugned order of the high court. the predecessor of the appellants, i.e., shri lanka venkateswarlu, (hereinafter referred to as 'original plaintiff'), brought a suit o.s. no. 72 of 1979 before the subordinate judge visakhapatnam for the declaration of his title as the absolute owner of the suit schedule property and for permanent injunction restraining respondents nos. 1 and 2 from interfering with his peaceful possession. the suit schedule property, to the extent of 2 acres was, according to the original plaintiff, covered by survey no. 73/12 in thokada village. he had purchased the suit schedule property by a registered sale deed dated 15th july, 1961 from one gonna appanna son of venkataswamy of china gantyda village. the original plaintiff was constrained to file the aforesaid suit on coming to know that respondent nos. 1 and 2 were claiming the suit schedule land to be "banjar land" which vested in the government. he had also learned that the land was in imminent danger of being illegally alienated by the respondent nos. 1 and 2. they were claiming that the land was required to issue pattas to weaker sections of society.
4. respondent nos. 1 and 2 were impleaded as the defendants to the suit. subsequently, the suit was transferred to the court of ivth additional district judge, visakhapatnam and renumbered as o.s. no. 83 of 1981.
5. the aforesaid averments of the original plaintiffs were controverted by the respondent nos. 1 and 2. it was claimed that the plaint schedule property was not covered by old survey no. 73/12 of the original village of thokada. the boundaries as well as survey number were stated to be fictitious, forged and imaginary. even the ownership of the ancestors of the vendor of the original plaintiff of the suit schedule land was denied. further, the alleged sale deed dated 15th july, 1961 between the original plaintiff and the vendor was denied. it was also stated that the original plaintiff was not in possession and enjoyment of the plaint schedule property.
6. on the pleadings of the parties, the trial court framed six issues. issue no. 1 pertains to the title of the original plaintiff to the schedule property. issues no.2 & 3 were with regard to, whether the original plaintiff was entitled to relief of declaration and injunction as prayed for. issue no.4 was whether the suit is not maintainable. a perusal of the judgment of the trial court shows that the suit was hotly contested on each and every issue. issues 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 were decided in favour of the original plaintiff and against the defendants, i.e., respondent nos. 1 and 2. issue no.5 with regard to valuation of the suit was not pressed by the government pleader. the suit was decreed by judgment dated 24th september, 1982.
7. the respondents challenged the aforesaid judgment and decree by filing an appeal before the high court of andhra pradesh being a.s. no. 8 of 1985. the sole respondent, i.e., original plaintiff died on 25th february, 1990. therefore, the advocate appearing for the deceased original plaintiff being the 'sole respondent' in the appeal filed a memo before the high court giving intimation about the death of his client. the memo was filed after giving notice to the advocate for respondent nos. 1 and 2, who were appellants in the aforesaid appeals. in spite of such intimation, respondent nos. 1 and 2 failed to bring the legal representatives of the deceased original plaintiff on record.
8. from the judgment of the high court it is apparent that the appeal came up for hearing on 24th april, 1997. at that stage, the counsel for the appellants again brought to the notice of the court that his client has passed away on 25th february, 1990. the high court directed the government pleader to take steps to bring on the record the legal representatives of the original plaintiff and posted the matter for hearing on 16th june, 1997. it appears that no actions were taken by the respondents to comply with the order passed by the high court on 24th april, 1997. therefore, on 6th february, 1998, justice v. rajagopala reddy, j. passed the following order:-
9. the aforesaid order was admittedly not complied with. consequently, the appeal stood abated in terms of the order dated 6th february, 1998. it appears that thereafter cmpsr no. 49656 of 2000 was moved by respondent nos. 1 and 2 seeking condonation of 883 days delay in filing the petition to set aside the dismissal order dated 6th february, 1998. the application was accompanied by an affidavit where it is candidly admitted by respondent no.2 that the order dated 6th february, 1998 was not complied with. it was further admitted that as the order dated 6th february, 1998 was not complied with, the default order came into force and the appeal stood dismissed.
10. in this affidavit, the explanation given is that the predecessors of the officer, who affirmed the affidavit dated 11th july, 2000 came to know about the dismissal of the appeal during the course of investigation in original o.s. no. 6 of 2000 which had been filed by the widow and the children of the deceased original plaintiff, i.e., sole respondent in the appeal. it is also admitted that thereafter, an application was filed for setting aside the order of abatement dated 6th february, 1998, but, without any application seeking condonation of delay of 883 days in filing the petition. to cover the foresaid lapse, cmp no. 21118 of 2003 was filed seeking condonation of delay of 883 days in filing the petition.
11. thereafter cmpsr no. 58644 of 2000 was filed on 17th august, 2000 with a prayer to condone the delay of 3703 days to bring the legal representatives on record. cmpsr no. 58646 of 2000 was filed to bring the legal representatives of the deceased original plaintiff on record and cmpsr no. 58645 of 2000 to set aside the order of dismissal in as no. 8 of 1985 dated 6th february, 1998 was filed. these applications were subsequently numbered as noted in the heading of the impugned judgment.
12. it appears from the impugned order of the high court and cmpsr no. 58644 of 2000 was numbered as cmp no. 17186 of 2000 on 17th august, 2000 and listed before the court on 27th september, 2000. the high court granted two weeks time for filing the counter. the aforesaid cmp was posted for hearing before the bench on 16th october, 2000 (venkatanarayan,j.). at that time, counsel for the deceased original plaintiff submitted that his client had died in 1990 and he had no instructions. therefore, the court directed to issue notice to the parties on the petition. even at that stage the government pleader did not bring to the notice of the court that the applications filed by respondent nos. 1 and 2 to set aside the order of dismissal and to bring the legal representatives on record were pending consideration.
13. thereafter it appears the matter was adjourned on a number of occasions from 27th june, 2001 to 9th april, 2002. surprisingly, on 3rd june, 2002 the government pleader again took time from the court to verify whether any separate application was filed for restoration of the appeal and whether any such application was pending or not. thereafter the matter was not pursued by the government pleader.
14. in the meantime, the alleged beneficiaries to whom pattas had been granted by the government poramboke in the year 1979 filed cmp no. 21705 of 2000, seeking permission of the court to come on record as the third appellant in the appeal. in the impugned order, it is also pointed out that the pendency of the applications had come to the notice of the court intermittently. it appears that the application to condone the delay in filing the petition for setting aside the order of dismissal was filed, when the lapse was pointed by the court.
15. thereafter, it seems that without the adjudication of any of the applications on merits, the appeal was listed for hearing before the bench, which culminated into passing the judgment and order dated 19th august, 2003, subject matter of the present appeal. by the aforesaid judgment, the high court has allowed all the applications restored the appeal posted it for hearing on 25th august, 2003.
16. this court while issuing notice in the slp on 15th december, 2003 directed that "in the meantime, proceedings in the appeal pending in the high court shall remain stayed". therefore, it is evident that the situation today is as it was when the order was passed on 6th february, 1998, i.e., appeal filed by the respondent nos. 1 and 2 stood abated and hence dismissed.
