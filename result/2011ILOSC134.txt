2. m.v. jagat priya was manufactured by m/s. hindustan shipyard ltd. in the year 1975 in a customs bonded warehouse at vishakapatanam, using certain imported items. the said vessel was cleared on 30th november, 1975, and was delivered to m/s. dempo steamship ltd. for a consideration of '7,61,12,400/- and central excise duty at the rate of 1% was paid thereon. the vessel was registered as indian vessel tonnage and flying an indian flag. however, it ceased to ply and was grounded at bedi bunder, jamnagar, in june 1986. on 16th october, 1992, an order was passed by the high court of judicature at bombay in admiralty suit at the instance of union of india and the shipping credit and investment co. of india ltd. for auction of the vessel on "as is where is" basis "free from all encumbrances and existing liens".
3. on 12th february, 1993, the vessel was auctioned and being the highest bidder, the appellant viz. m/s. mustan taherbhai purchased the vessel. the sale in favour of the appellant was confirmed by the high court and in furtherance thereof, the possession of the ship was delivered on 4th march, 1993. thereafter, on 10th may, 1993, on the direction of the superintendent of central excise & customs, the appellant filed a bill of entry claiming that the ship was an indian built ship, and therefore, no customs duty was payable. on 12th may, 1993, the superintendent of central excise, jamnagar passed a provisional assessment order demanding customs duty @ 5%, and an additional duty of '1000/- per ldt.
4. being aggrieved, the appellant preferred special civil application no. 4924 of 1993 before the high court of gujarat. the high court, vide interim order dated 25th may, 1993, permitted the appellant to clear the materials obtained by breaking the ship in question without payment of provisional duty on the condition that the appellant will file a bond with security deposit. vide order dated 23rd july, 1993, the high court disposed of the said application, and directed the appellant to file an appeal before the commissioner (appeals). accordingly, the appellant preferred an appeal before the commissioner (appeals).
5. the commissioner (appeals), vide order dated 29th april, 1994, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order of provisional assessment dated 12th may, 1993.
6. being aggrieved, the appellant preferred an appeal before the tribunal. vide order dated 10th july, 1998 the tribunal dismissed the appeal. relying on the decision of this court in union of india & ors. vs. m/s. jalyan udyog & anr., (1994) 1 scc 318
7. being dissatisfied, the appellant preferred an application under section 129(b)(2) of
praying for rectification of mistakes in the order, dated 10th july, 1998, on the ground that the tribunal had erroneously concluded that: (i) the goods manufactured in a customs bonded warehouse were similar to goods imported under
; (ii) the issue for determination before it was whether notification no. 133/87-cus was applicable or not, whereas the real issue for determination was whether the vessel was imported or indigenously manufactured; (iii) the customs duty under notification no. 133/87-cus was payable when notification no. 118/59-cus was applicable; (iv) since the vessel was subsequently being broken up, its clearance would be governed by notification no. 262/58-cus; and (v) the decision in jalyan udyog
8. vide order dated 13th april, 1999, the tribunal dismissed the said application on the ground that it is a settled position that goods manufactured in a customs bonded warehouse are treated akin to goods manufactured in a foreign country, and when the vessel was taken out of the country for plying as foreign going vessel, and subsequently, the said vessel is brought back to india for breaking purposes, it amounts to re- import.
9. aggrieved, the appellant preferred yet another application under section 129(b)(2) of
for rectification of mistakes in the order of the tribunal dated 13th april, 1999 on the ground that in union of india vs. baijnath melaram, 1998 (97) elt 27
10. still aggrieved, the appellant preferred c.a. no. 1998 of 2000 before this court. vide order dated 30th august, 2001, this court, while remanding the matter back to the tribunal, observed thus:
it is plain from a bare reading of the said order that this court had directed the tribunal to first appreciate the facts of the case and then determine the question of leviability of import duty on an indian built ship which was sold for breaking. it is evident from the afore-extracted paragraph that the court had observed that reliance by the tribunal on the decision of this court in jalyan udyog
11. accordingly, the tribunal re-considered the matter. as stated above, vide the impugned order, the tribunal has dismissed the appeal, observing thus:
12. hence, the present appeal.
