b. whether the governor had rightly exercised his power to pardon under article 161?
18. article 161 of the
confers on the governor of a state the right to grant pardons, remissions, reprieves or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the state extends.
19. the nature and scope of the power of pardon and the extent of judicial review over such power has come up for consideration in a catena of cases and has now virtually crystallised into a rule of law.

21. the court further observed that
(para 63 at p. 2170-71)
22. the bench cautioned that political vendetta or party favouritism should not be the basis of exercising such power. it also advised that the government should make rules for its own guidance in the exercise of the pardon power to exclude the vice of discrimination.
23. in conclusion, the bench observed that considerations for exercise of power under articles 72/161 "

29. further, if the governor was not aware of general considerations such as period of sentence undergone by the convict, his conduct and behaviour while undergoing sentence and other such material considerations, it would make the order of the governor under article 161 arbitrary and irrational.

32. justice pasayat, delivering the judgment, summed up the ground on which judicial review of an order passed under articles 72 and 161 could be undertaken. those grounds are:
(a) that the order has been passed without application of mind;
(c) that the order has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations;
(d) that relevant materials have been kept out of consideration;
(e) that the order suffers from arbitrariness.
33. justice kapadia (as his lordship then was) in his concurring opinion, observed that
(para 64 at p. 3402)
34. his lordship further added that "
(para 65, 67 at p. 3402)
35. in that case, an order of remission had been passed, inter alia, on an inference that the accused was not involved in the murder, was falsely implicated and false witnesses had been produced. this court held such reasons to be irrelevant and held that the order of remission was bad.
44. the appeals are thus disposed of. no orders as to costs.
