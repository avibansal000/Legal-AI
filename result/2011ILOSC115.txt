the judgment was delivered by : hon'ble justice d. k. jain
1. challenge in these civil appeals, filed under section 130e of the
(for short "
"), is to the orders dated 1st october, 2001 and 4th january, 2005 passed by the customs, excise & gold (control) appellate tribunal (for short "the cegat") and the customs, excise & service tax appellate tribunal (for short "the cestat") respectively. in the first set of appeals (nos. 4294-4295 of 2002), the cegat has held that the commissioner of customs (preventive), mumbai, not being a "proper officer" as defined in section 2(34) of
, did not have jurisdiction to issue show cause notice in terms of section 28 of
. however, in the second set of appeals (nos. 4603-4604 of 2005), the cestat has, to the contrary, held that the commissioner of customs (preventive), mumbai had jurisdiction to issue notice under section 28 of
.
respondent no. 1 is a partner in respondent no. 2 firm viz. m/s. handloom carpet, which is engaged in the business of carpet manufacture/export. respondent no. 2 was charged with misusing the export pass book scheme by selling goods cleared duty free in the open market or selling the pass book on premium in violation of the itc restriction imposed on such sale. investigations in the matter were conducted by the marine and preventive wing of the customs. on 28th august, 1991, the assistant collector of customs (preventive), mumbai, issued to the respondents a show cause notice, alleging violation of the provisions of section 111(d) of
. on 3rd february, 1993, the same officer adjudicated upon the said show cause notice, confirming the demands raised in the show cause notice.
3. being aggrieved, the respondents preferred an appeal before the collector of customs (appeals), who vide order dated 14th december, 1993, allowed the appeal holding that since the matter involved demand of duty beyond a period of six months, the show cause notice was required to be issued by the collector, and not by the assistant collector. nevertheless, the collector (appeals) granted liberty to the department to re-adjudicate the case by issuing a proper show cause notice.
4. accordingly, the collector of customs (preventive) issued show cause notice dated 16th april, 1994 asking the respondents to show cause as to why the goods under seizure valued at rs.1,04,118.52/- should not be confiscated, and customs duty amounting to rs.5,07,274/- be not levied in terms of section 28(1) of
were also proposed.
5. in reply to the show cause notice, the jurisdiction of the collector of customs (preventive) was questioned on the ground that the jurisdiction of a commissioner by virtue of notification no. 251/83 being more specific and limited in nature, the said notification will prevail over notification no.250/83. vide order dated 19th august, 1996, the collector of customs (preventive) rejected the objections regarding his jurisdiction, holding thus:
the collector confirmed the demand of duty of rs. 5,07,274/-under section 28(1) of
. he also ordered confiscation of two consignments of dyes sulphur blue and sulphur blue green valued at rs. 1,34,118.52/-, and imposed a redemption fine of rs. 1,50,000/-.
7. at the sake of repetition, it may be noted that although the facts obtaining in c.a. nos. 4603-4604 of 2005 were similar to those in c.a. nos. 4294- 4295 of 2002, but, in the former case, following the decision of its larger bench in konia trading co. vs. commissioner of customs, jaipur, 2004 (170) e.l.t. 51
, set aside the order of adjudication passed by the said officer with a direction that the issues be determined afresh by the jurisdictional collector of customs who had earlier assessed the bill of entry in question at bombay port.
8. hence, the present cross appeals by the revenue and the importers. at the very outset, we may clarify that these appeals are confined only to the question of validity of the demands raised by virtue of re-assessment orders passed by the collector of customs (preventive) mumbai, pursuant to the issue of show cause notices under section 28 of
. for the sake of convenience, hereinafter, both the cestat and cegat are referred to as "the tribunal".
