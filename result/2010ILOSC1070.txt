.
23. the precise question is whether after the amendment to the 1961 act, the right and authority of the senior up-pramukh to discharge the duties of the pramukh would survive or whether the district magistrate can nominate an elected member to be the pramukh when the post of pramukh falls vacant and till the new pramukh is elected or resumes office.
24. one argument raised by the respondent is that the up-pramukh would automatically become the pramukh when the post of pramukh falls vacant, as was the position before the
was enforced. it was also urged that the same is justified under section 7(3) as amended. section 7(3) reads as follows:
25. the respondents argued that the words "continue to hold office as such" entitled the up-pramukh to discharge all the functions and duties of senior up- pramukh as were prevalent before the
was introduced. prior to amendment, rights of senior up-pramukh included the right to function and discharge the duties of pramukh when the office of pramukh was vacant. this contention of the respondents was accepted by the high court, which is why the appellants filed the present batch of appeals before this court.
26. the appellants however put forward their case under sections 9(2) and 9a of the
27. the appellants claimed that as per the abovementioned provisions, it was for the district magistrate to appoint a pramukh when the post of the pramukh fell vacant, and the up-pramukh could not automatically discharge the functions as pramukh when the post of pramukh fell vacant, after the enforcement of the
.
was introduced in 2007 to make the state laws regulating the panchayats compatible with the provisions of part ix of the
has been upheld by this court in the bhanumati case
31. before the
was introduced, the 1961 act provided that in case the post of pramukh fell vacant, the up-pramukh would discharge the functions of the pramukh till a new pramukh was appointed. however, the
abolished the said post of up-pramukh from the kshettra panchayats and provided that in cases where the post of pramukh fell vacant, the district magistrate was to make such arrangements as he thought fit. however, as per section 7(3), the up-pramukh would still continue to hold office as such till the end of their term.
, and to what extent?
b. how is the expression "shall continue to hold office as such" to be construed?
33. interpretation of non-obstante clauses has come up for consideration before this court in a large number of decisions.
34. in aswini kumar ghose & anr. v. arabinda bose & anr, reported in air 1952 sc 369
35. again in another constitution bench judgment of this court in the dominion of india & anr. v. shrinbai a. irani and another, reported in air 1954 sc 596

39. in central bank of india v. state of kerala & ors, reported in (2009) 4 scc 94
40. in view of such consistent opinion expressed by this court on the purport and meaning of non-obstante clause we are of the view that the operation of a non-obstante clause in section 7(3) of the amended act shall be subject to the intent of the legislature, and must be interpreted in line with the scheme of the act and the purpose for which it was enacted.
